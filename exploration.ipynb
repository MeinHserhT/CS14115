As such, marketing teams are challenged to make appropriate investments in promotional strategies.\n\n- Goal: Analyze a Google Merchandise Store (also known as GStore, where Google swag is sold) customer dataset to <b>predict revenue per customer</b>\n\n- Data format: \n    + Each row in the dataset is one visit to the store. \n    + <b>Not all rows in test_v2.csv will correspond to a row in the submission</b>, but all unique fullVisitorIds will correspond to a row in the submission.\n    + Due to the formatting of fullVisitorId you must <b>load the Id's as strings in order for all Id's to be properly unique!</b>\n    + There are multiple columns which contain JSON blobs of varying depth. In one of those JSON columns, totals, the sub-column transactionRevenue contains the revenue information we are trying to predict. This sub-column exists only for the training data.\n\n\n- Input: user transactions which are collected from GStore around the world.\n\n- Output: ALL users' transactions in the future time period of December 1st 2018 through January 31st 2019.\n + Public LB: is being calculated for those visitors during the same timeframe of 5/1/18 to 10/15/18\n + Private LB: is being calculated on the future-looking timeframe of 12/1/18 to 1/31/19 - for those same set of users.\n \n => Therefore, your submission that is intended for the public LB timeframe will be different from the private LB timeframe, which will be rescored/recalculated on the future timeframe.\n \n We are predicting the <b>natural log of the sum of all transactions per user</b>. \n \n$$\ny_{user} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} transaction_{user_i} \n$$\n$$\ntarget_{user} = \\ln({y_{user}+1})\n$$\n \n\n- External Data: is <b>permitted</b> for this competition. This includes the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6367342#access&zippy=%2Cin-this-article\">Google Merchandise Store Demo Account</a>. Although the Demo Account contains the predicted variable, final standings will not benefit from access to this external data, because it requires future-looking predictions.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.
